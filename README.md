# A Sample React Application for Profile Page.

# This is a React JS application, for a profile page. Created with responsiveness in mind, the site can render effectively in most of the common mobile devices. 

 There are 3 components working in this project. 
1. The Navbar to Render the navigation on top,
2. The Home Page, that is responsible for displaying the Cover Image and the whole Bio of the user;
3. And finally there's the "Tales" component, that renders the "Tales" the user has written on the platform.

 Currently the tales are being fetched from a JSON file, in the frontend. Which can easily be replaced with using a Database like MongoDB with the help of Server-Side Scripting Language. And of course using NodeJS as Backend Technology.

Technologies used: 

ReactJS 

Libraries Used:
React-Router-Dom : React Router DOM is an npm package that enables to implement dynamic routing in a web app. It allows us to display pages and allow users to navigate them.
That's it. Rest of the Application is hardcoded. (Even the UI ðŸ˜‰)
